/*
Determine the number of bits required to flip if you want to convert integer n to integer m.

Notice
    Both n and m are 32-bit integers.

Example
    Given n = 31 (11111), m = 14 (01110), return 2.

Thought process:
    Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm:
    Subtraction of 1 from a number toggles all the bits (from right to left) till the rightmost set bit(including the righmost set bit). 
    So if we subtract a number by 1 and do bitwise & with itself (n & (n-1)), we unset the righmost set bit. 
    If we do n & (n-1) in a loop and count the no of times loop executes we get the set bit count.
