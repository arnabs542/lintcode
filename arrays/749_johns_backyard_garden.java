/*
John wants to build a back garden on the empty space behind his home. There are two kinds of bricks now, one is 3 dm high and the other is 7 dm high. John wants to enclose a high x dm wall. If John can do this, output YES, otherwise NO.

Notice
    X is an integer, and it's range is [3, 1000].

Example
    Give x = 10,return YES.

Explanation:
    x = 3 + 7:That is, you need one batch of 3 dm height bricks and one batch of 7 dm height bricks.
    Give x = 5,return NO.

    John can not enclose a high 5 dm wall with 3 dm height bricks and 7 dm height bricks.
    Give x = 13,return YES.

    x = 2 * 3 + 7:That is, you need two batch of 3 dm height bricks and one batch of 7 dm height bricks.

Thought process:
    Similar to "Unbounded Knapsack" problem.
