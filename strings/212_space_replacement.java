/*
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with %20. The string is given in a characters array, you can assume it has enough space for replacement and you are given the true length of the string.
You code should also return the new length of the string after replacement.

Notice
    If you are using Java or Pythonï¼Œplease use characters array instead of string.

Example
    Given "Mr John Smith", length = 13.
    The string after replacement should be "Mr%20John%20Smith", you need to change the string in-place and return the new length 17.

Challenge
    Do it in-place.
*/

/*
Thought process:
    1. It is hard to solve it in forward order loop. 
       But there are enough empty space at the end of the array, so we can loop backward.
    2. Notice we have to do an extra loop to count the spaces and the total length of the new array.

                string[ix--] = '0';
                string[ix--] = '2';
